Classes and Decorators to use FastAPI with `class based routing`. In particular this allows you to
construct an **instance** of a class and have methods of that instance be route handlers for FastAPI & Python 3.8.

- Older Versions of Python:
  - Unfortunately this does not work with `async` routes with Python versions less than 3.8 [due to bugs in `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52422903/1431244). Specifically with older versions of Python `iscoroutinefunction` incorrectly returns false so `async` routes aren't `await`'d. We therefore only support Python versions >= 3.8.

## Example üê¢

```py
from ping import pong
# Some fictional ping pong class
from fastapi_class import Routable, get, delete

def parse_arg() -> argparse.Namespace:
   """parse command line arguments."""
   ...


class UserRoutes(Routable):
   """Inherits from Routable."""

   # Note injection here by simply passing values to the constructor.
   # Other injection frameworks also work.
   # supported as there's nothing special about this __init__ method.
   def __init__(self, pong: pong) -> None:
      """Constructor. The pong is injected here."""
      self.__pong = pong

   @get('/user/{name}')
   def get_user_by_name(name: str) -> User:
      # Use our injected pong instance.
      return self.__pong.get_user_by_name(name)

   @delete('/user/{name}')
   def delete_user(name: str) -> None:
      self.__pong.delete(name)


def main():
    args = parse_args()
    # Configure the pong per command line arguments
    pong = pong(args.url, args.user, args.password)
    # Simple intuitive injection
    user_routes = UserRoutes(pong)

    app = FastAPI()
    # router member inherited from Routable and configured per the annotations.
    app.include_router(user_routes.router)
```
